Use pandas to preprocess the initial data.
	Use 'PCA.py' for principal component analysis.
	Use 'deal.py' to remove useless columns, delete empty data items, remove duplicate rows.
	Count the number of people with different degrees of injury(unscathed,killed,hospital,light) in the 'users.csv' to the accident('target.csv').
Data analysis.
	Use 'start.py' to build different machine learning models to predict the number of different degrees of injuries caused by accidents that have occurred.
	'Predicted_accuracyOrPredicted_number_of_deaths(Pca_data&initial_data).PNG' is graph of the accuracy of predicting the number of deaths and the number of predicted deaths using four models.
	Calculate the option that has the most occurrences of each column in the 'caracteristics.csv' by 'calculate.py' (The result is in StatisticalData.txt)
	Clusting by 'clusting.py'
